        <p> At the very core of IM&T, I learned how information is utilized within an organization. I gained an understanding on how modern companies collect, process, and provide data. This is done through human interaction with information and their systems/technologies. The courses I took in this knowledge area not only gave me an understanding of what it means to be an Information Organization but also how to work in one. Through collaboration, team work, and creative thinking, I learned the ins and outs of modern office life.</p>

            <p class="indent"> In this assignment, I chose to analyze the Organization Culture that Chick-fil-A presents to its customers.   This refelction is a small glimpse into the importance of progressive change and inclusivity in the modern workplace. Their strict religious views and harsh stand against the LGBTQ was causing an external pressure on their company. </p>

            <p class="indent"> Each week in my Intro to Information based Organizations class, I was required to give a breif content presentation based on what we were learning. Since we were learning the different aspects that make up both good and bad organizational culture, I decieced to present on an instance that happened at Tesla. They're use of contract workers to boost production was bringing a problematic view on Tesla's culture.  </p>
